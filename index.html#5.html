    <h1>No Sin Is Too Great for God's Forgiveness</h1>

    <p>
      It doesn't matter the kind of sins or mistakes you have committed—God’s forgiveness and acceptance are greater. His mercy extends beyond your past, reaching into your present with love and hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bible clearly shows this in the story of the prodigal son (<span class="scripture">Luke 15:11–32</span>), where a wayward child is welcomed back not with punishment, but with open arms and rejoicing. It is a vivid picture of how God receives us when we turn back to Him.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
      <span class="scripture">—1 John 1:9</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>The Prodigal Son’s Story</strong><br/>
      The son strayed, rebelled, and fell. But when he returned in humility, his father ran to meet him. His father declared:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "'This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!'"
      <span class="scripture">—Luke 15:24</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Just like the father in the parable, God is waiting for you. He doesn’t shame you—He welcomes, forgives, and restores.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "'Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.'"
      <span class="scripture">—Matthew 11:28</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This message is a call to respond. God stands ready, knocking at the door of your heart.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "'Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.'"
      <span class="scripture">—Revelation 3:20</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Don’t let your past define you. Let God’s love and mercy restore you.
    </p>
