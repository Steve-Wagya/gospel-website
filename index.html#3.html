    <h1>The Need for Salvation</h1>
    <p>
      Humanity has always sought answers to life’s deepest questions: Why are we here? What happens after we die? Why is there suffering and sin? The Bible teaches that all people have sinned and fallen short of God's glory (<span class="highlight">Romans 3:23</span>), and that sin separates us from a holy God.
    </p>

    <p>
      Salvation is necessary because of this separation. Without it, humanity is lost—spiritually dead and without eternal hope. But the good news, or the <span class="highlight">Gospel</span>, is that Jesus Christ came to bridge that gap by offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through Him, we are given not only forgiveness of sins, but a restored relationship with God and the promise of eternal life (<span class="highlight">John 3:16</span>). This is not earned by works, but received through faith.
    </p>
