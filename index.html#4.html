    <h1>Salvation is Free and Not Sold</h1>
    <p>
      The concept that salvation is free and not sold is clearly taught in Scripture. Salvation is not earned, bought, or bargained for—it is the gracious gift of God offered freely to those who believe in Jesus Christ.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."
      <span class="verse-ref">—Ephesians 2:8–9</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "And all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus."
      <span class="verse-ref">—Romans 3:24</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "He said to me: 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.'"
      <span class="verse-ref">—Revelation 21:6</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost."
      <span class="verse-ref">—Isaiah 55:1</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      These passages highlight a powerful truth: God does not charge for His grace. He invites everyone—rich or poor, sinner or saint—to freely receive the gift of salvation through Christ. No human effort, payment, or qualification can replace the finished work of Jesus on the cross.
