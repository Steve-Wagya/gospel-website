    <h1>There Is A Need For Repentance</h1>
    <p>
      Repentance is more than feeling sorry—it is a change of direction. Literally, it means to turn back: to turn away from sin and self, and to turn toward God. True repentance is a conscious decision to forsake the old life and embrace a new one found in Christ.
    </p>

    <p>
      Repentance is inseparable from salvation. The Bible teaches that salvation requires both <strong>repentance from sin</strong> and <strong>faith in Jesus Christ</strong>. You cannot cling to sin and truly follow Christ. Repentance opens the door to God's forgiveness and grace.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
      then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
      <span class="verse-ref">—2 Chronicles 7:14</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This verse reflects God's promise: when we turn back to Him with sincere hearts, He is always ready to receive us. Repentance is not a one-time act, but a lifestyle of turning to God daily, trusting His mercy, and walking in His ways.
